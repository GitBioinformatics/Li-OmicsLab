# Research Interests

**課題組主要圍繞著 AI for Medical Sciences 展開，研究領域包括：**

1\) 人工智能因果推斷方法開發：搭建因果學習與機器學習的橋樑，發現大数据背後的因果產生機制，改善醫療模型分佈外泛化能力和可解釋性。

2\) 基於人工智能因果推斷的醫療大数据挖掘與分析、新型多模態模型的構建和新一代循證醫學。

Causal AI is the only technology that can reason and make choices like humans do.

3\) 人工智能因果推斷驅動的多組學數據整合分析（代謝組、蛋白組、暴露組等）以及其在複雜慢性疾病的發病機制、藥物新靶點發現、藥物作用機制等方面應用。

# Lab Members

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span statistics, physics, biology, applied mathematics, molecular biology, metascience, cognitive science, causal inference, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page]({{site.baseurl}}/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

# Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. 

Every week, more or less, we chat about current lab practices and sometimes vote on new things.

# Collaborators

Here are some cool people in fields that interest us. **note:** This list is in no way complete. We have a lot of collaborators -- if you've collaborated with us and want a link here, let us know!
