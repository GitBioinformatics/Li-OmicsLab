# Biography

Dr. Li is currently an associate professor at Faculty of Applied Sciences, Macao Polytechnic University. His research fields mainly include multi-omics data integration and its application in understanding the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, discovering novel drug targets, and evaluating drug toxicity. He is also interested in deep learning-based medical data analysis and developing novel multi-biomarker models for complex disorders. Dr. Li has developed one of the first next-generation broad-spectrum, single-injection metabolomics and exposomics methods. Until now, he has published over 100 papers in related fields, including World Psychiatry (5-year IF: 66.7, same below), PNAS (IF:13.45), Advanced Science (IF:18.94), BMC Medicine (IF:11.13), JACC Cardiovasc Interv. (IF:10.55), Environ Int. (IF:13.24), Environ Sci Technol. (IF:12.15), and Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. (IF:11.21). He has received grants from NSFC and other sources and serves as a grant reviewer for the U.S. EPA and the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Development. He is also on the editorial board of Current Pharmaceutical Design and a peer reviewer for over a dozen decent journals (IF > 10), such as Nature Communications and Annals of Internal Medicine.
